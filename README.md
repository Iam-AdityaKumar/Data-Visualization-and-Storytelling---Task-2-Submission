# Data Visualization and Storytelling - Task 2 Submission

## Introduction
This project focuses on creating compelling visualizations and telling a data-driven story using sales data. The goal is to analyze key metrics such as sales trends, regional performance, and product distribution.

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains sales data for a superstore, including details like Region, Category, Sales, Order Date, and Customer Segment.

## Key Insights
1. The West region contributes the most to sales, accounting for 40% of total revenue.
2. Office Supplies account for 50% of total sales, followed by Technology and Furniture.
3. Sales peak during December due to holiday season demand.

## Challenges Faced
1. The dataset did not include a Profit column, so I focused on analyzing sales trends and regional performance instead.

## Visualizations
1. Sales by Region (Bar Chart)
2. Monthly Sales Trends (Line Chart)
3. Sales Distribution by Category (Pie Chart)
4. Top-Selling Products (Horizontal Bar Chart)

## Conclusion
This task helped me master the art of visual storytelling and gain hands-on experience with Power BI.
